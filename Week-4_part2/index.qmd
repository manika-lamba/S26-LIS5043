## Database Searching {.smaller}

-   Effective database searching consists of:
    -   Analytical skills

        -   Understanding and extracting meaning out of user information
            needs

    -   Conceptual skills in developing search strategies

        -   Do we search for concepts or do we search for words?

    -   Technical skills particular to a search system

        -   Each database will have its own search functions, features,
            structure, etc.

::: notes
In this module, we are going to look at some strategies and techniques
that you can use for searching. We're going to primarily focus on
searching within the database environment rather than on the web. You
might recall in the earlier lecture in Module 3.2, we talked about
database and information retrieval systems and the different models
behind how these systems work.

In this lecture we're going to continue the idea of searching and
retrieval, but we're going to look specifically at some different
systems that you might use while you're in the program at OU and then
some skills and techniques that you can use in other environments as
well. To learn even more I recommend you take the **LIS 5523 Online
Information Retrieval** class.

It's really important to note that there are several different skills
sets that you're bringing to your database searching. Effective database
searching consists of analytical skills, conceptual skills, as well as
technical skills. Analytical skills are your understanding or being able
to extract meaning out of a user's information need.

Oftentimes when a user comes to you and needs help doing a search or if
you're conducting a search for someone that you received via email, or
on the phone, or chat, you're going to have to, first, have a very good
understanding of what it is that they really want. And oftentimes a user
is not exactly sure what they want or what they need in particular
circumstances.

So, an important part of effective searching is then helping the user
understand their information need by asking a lot of targeted questions,
which we'll discuss in a few minutes. So, analytical skills are really
key to good database searching.

Conceptual skills are also really important when you're developing
search strategies for searching. We think about searching as putting
together strings of words, or words that somehow represent our users'
information needs or our own information needs if we're searching for
ourselves.

But what we're really doing when we search is putting together words to
represent concepts or sets of concepts that then represent that
information need. So, we're not just aiming to search with words, we're
aiming to represent the concepts that are present in the information
need.

And this takes quite a bit of skill as well as quite a bit of time to
think through your searches and not just type in the first word that
comes to your mind, which is primarily how most people search. The third
set of skills that is really important are the technical skills that are
particular to a specific search system.

We've been talking a lot about structures of databases or structures of
our search systems and how that can impact our searching, and it becomes
really important, especially when you have a very complex search where
you may have to combine several different fields in a database, you
might need to know what kind of indexing is behind those fields. The
majority of our proprietary databases nowadays are creating inverted
indexes behind the fields in the database, and they're generally word
and phrase indexed.

So, you can put in one word or you can put in multiple words using the
parameters of that system. It's also really important to know which
search functions are available in your database. Most systems have
either implicit or explicit Boolean operator searches as a possibility,
but then there are some other higher level skills that we can use, such
as proximity searching or truncation and wildcards, which we'll go into
in a few minutes.

Each of these is designed to help you become even more precise in your
search and, in some cases, to increase recall as well. So, it's really
important when you start to learn a new database or a suite of
databases, such as EBSCO or ProQuest, that you look up what the search
functions are, that you try to determine what types of searching are
possible within the systems, how they handle plurals, what their stop
word lists might include, how the database is structured, and the
differences between using advanced search versus a simple search or a
basic search.

There is a great deal you can learn by looking at the help or FAQ pages
for the different systems that you're using. So, now that we've talked a
little bit about some of the skills that we need, let's talk about ten
steps to good database searching.
:::

## Steps to Follow When Searching

![](images/paste-5C3867E2.png){fig-align="center" width="580"}

::: notes
The first step is to read the query. We can substitute that for either
listen to the query and also understand the query. So, if you're being
sent a search in email or via chat, you're going to read the query, but
you have to really read the query, meaning that you have to discern the
meaning underneath the words in the user's query. If you're talking to
the user, you need to actively listen to the query and start thinking
about potential questions to ask them.

As part of read the query, you need to make sure you really understand
what the user wants, and if they can't spell it out for you, you need to
ask more probing questions to find out exactly what they want. Or you
may go back to the user at a later point and ask them further questions
once you start searching. The second step is to identify the major
concepts in the query.

Parse apart the words and start thinking about what concepts you will be
representing in the search terms. Third, you need to identify potential
terms to correspond to those concepts. So, you're going to think about
what words you might use to represent the concepts. And then you're
going to select alternative terms to use if the original strategy needs
refining, such as broader terms, narrower terms, or related terms. We're
just going to walk through these steps quickly, and then we'll go back
through them in more depth.
:::

## Steps to Follow When Searching

![](images/paste-615E5423.png){fig-align="center" width="532"}

::: notes
The fifth step is to determine logical or Boolean relationships that
could exist between the terms and the concepts. The sixth--and this is a
very important step--is to choose the appropriate sources in which to
conduct your searches.

Choose databases that are on the topic itself, or if it's a very general
kind of search, try to find a database that's going to include the types
of resources that you envision would hold that information.

Seven is, of course, to begin the search. Eight is to look at a few of
the results and to evaluate whether or not your search is successful or
if you need to rethink the terms or concepts or if you need to go back
even further in your analysis. Nine is to revise and refine the search
based on your initial results.
:::

## Step 1

![](images/paste-DA469959.png){fig-align="center" width="525"}

::: notes
Okay, let's talk about step one. Again, it was to read the query, to
understand the query, to listen to the query. Step one is really about
conducting a really good reference interview. Now, I don't know if
you've encountered this term in other courses or not, but a reference
interview is something that we do when we talk to users about their
information needs.

The first step, of course, is to get as much information as you possibly
can. And again, this is going to be limited by the type of system that
intermediating between you and the user. If you're on the phone, you can
ask for a lot of information, if you're via chat, you can continue to
chat, but if you get something in email, you might have to have a series
of emails over a protracted time period in order to gather what you
need.

When you're talking to the user, ask for useful terms, talk to them
about their own prior searching and what they've looked for and what
they've used, ask about any known authors or experts that might be part
of a search or that you might want to look for; ask about sources that
they've used or that they want you to use.

And it's really important to find out what types of sources they really
need.

-   Do they need journal articles, and if so, do they have to be
    peer-reviewed? Depending upon your user, they may not know what that
    means, so you'll have to explain it further.

-   Do they want books?

-   Do they want conference proceedings, which would be a group of
    papers that are presented at a specialized conference?

So, again, find out what type of sources they need as well, and that's
going to help you limit your search.

Determine criteria for evaluation, and there, of course, can be several
different criteria, but some of the most prevalent would be like
currency--how current does the resource need to be, the information that
you find; are we looking at, archival materials where we need to go back
into a backlog or back file, or do we need something that was published
last week?

So talk to them about their expectations for date restrictions.

-   What kind of formats do they want?

-   Do they need PDF files, do they want HTML?

They more than likely want full text retrieval if you're looking for
journal articles or conference proceedings. They want something they can
use immediately. But they also might want images. They might want video
or audio.

So, again, talk to them about different formats. And then also ask them
what is not wanted.

-   Are there materials that they already know about?

-   Have they conducted their own searches and what have they found?

-   Are there things that they don't want to address?

-   Talk to them about the scope of the question as well, and, you know,
    what to include and what not to include in your search.
:::

## Step 2: Identify major concepts to use

`Concept analysis`

**concept** : *"abstract idea of a thing, regardless of what it may be
called in a given instance. May have more than one recognizable name"*

(eg. instructor: may also be teacher, professor, lecturer, etc.)

::: notes
Step two is probably what I think is the best part of searching, and
that's when you identify the major concepts that represent the
information need. You would complete what's called a concept analysis.
Remember what I said, when we search, we're forced to use words, but
we're thinking about concepts. A concept means, "an abstract idea of a
thing, regardless of what it may be called in a given instance. It may
have more than one recognizable name." This is a really important point.
You might put into your search the first word that comes to your mind
when you're thinking of a particular concept. So, if you're looking for
'instructor' for example, there are multiple other terms that can be
used to represent the same concept. It can be 'teacher,' 'professor,'
'lecturer,' or other terms you can think of. So, again, you need to look
at the query, understand the query, and identify the major concepts that
are present in that query. And then you start thinking about other
terms.
:::

## Step 2 (Cont.)

![](images/paste-BC15371B.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

::: notes
When we put together a search, we do what's called 'building blocks' or
'playing with Legos' during concept analysis. Each word that you use to
represent the concepts that are present in the information need are what
we might think of as a Lego block, and you're going to build some
structure out of your Legos.

You put words together to make a concept, and you're going to use
multiple types of words to form those concepts. And you might have
multiple concepts that you need to use to represent that information
need. You are going to put those concepts together into what we call a
search string. The search string is what you enter into your database.

Now, just like Legos, words and concepts of a search are
interchangeable, movable and adaptable, meaning that you might have to
rethink the words you're using if they're not working in your search.
You can move them around. You know, put them in different orders or put
them in different groupings, but again, you have to keep in mind how
you're combining them. So, think about the formulation of your query as
playing with Legos. Think about building some kind of a structure out of
each of those different Legos.
:::

## Step 3: Identify terms to use

![](images/paste-3659D359.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
So, now we've identified several concepts, and we've started to think
about how we can put words together to represent those concepts in our
query. The next thing that I want you to do is to identify terms that
you can use. And I want you to find multiple terms to represent each
concept. Don't just use the one term, because you never know how it's
being used in the system.

Now, the difference between this idea and one form of searching, which
is controlled vocabulary searching, is that there is only one word that
represents that concept in the system. When you do controlled vocabulary
searching, you're using the thesaurus of the system, or you're using the
authorized terms that someone has decided will represent those concepts
within that particular system. This is analogous to when we assign
subject headings from Library of Congress or from Sears Subject Headings
to represent the subjects in library catalog records. And there are
definitely advantages and disadvantages to using controlled vocabulary
searches.

So, for step three, you're going to find multiple terms to represent
each concept. It's really helpful to use a search form and to write out
all the different concepts and the terms that you've identified. And
then also, you can build in those relationships. When I learned to
search, it was pre-Web days, and we constructed our searches offline
before we even logged on to systems like Dialog because the system was
very expensive to use. You remember we didn't have the graphical user
interfaces that we have today. We had very clunky screens with green
lettering on black screens, and it was not a very conducive environment
for searching.

So, you're going to find multiple terms. You're going to think also
about forms of the words you want to use, and you're going to think
about whether you should truncate something or not. Now, truncating
means that you're taking the word down to its root. For example, if
you're looking for the word "computers", for example, but you think
there might also be something in an article about computing, you would
enter as your search term "comput" and then whatever the character is
that that system uses for truncation--some use question marks, some use
asterisks, and some even use number signs.

So, again, that's one thing you have to find out about your system, is
how to truncate. Truncation is useful because it gets more than just one
form of the word, and some systems will default to either a singular or
a plural search if you're not truncating at all. So it's, again, useful
to know how the system deals with plural and singular forms of words.
Truncation, again, offers you the ability to search for more than just
one form of a word.

It is important to remember that there is not just one right way for
formulate a search. Each of you is probably going to approach searches
in different ways and use different operators, use different words, and
that's okay. But again, you need to remember that the term you choose
may not necessarily be used within the system itself, so think about
alternative ones as well. And use a search form to structure your
searches ahead of time.
:::

## Step 4: Select alternative terms

![](images/paste-C3CD8624.png){fig-align="center" width="63%"}

::: notes
So, now that you've identified other terms to use, or you've selected
terms, also think of broader terms, narrower terms, related terms, or
completely different terms or concepts if the concept you're using
really doesn't pan out. The next step, then, is to identify the
relationships between the different terms and concepts.
:::

## Step 5: Define relationships

![](images/paste-4F50F554.png)

::: notes
When we define relationships in a database, you are thinking about how
you're going to put them together using Boolean operators. We use
Boolean operators to connect the terms or those concept blocks that you
formed earlier. There are three different Boolean operators, the OR, the
AND, or the NOT. We'll talk about what each of these does in the system
in just a moment.

But what's really important--if you can find this information in these
systems, and sometimes it's not talked about even in their FAQs; you
have to find it out through trial and error--is you have to first
determine which are used in the system. And that's pretty evident; in
most systems you can see the drop down menus that let you add AND, OR,
and NOT between the search terms.

You also have to determine the order of operation, or how the system
treats the operators. Does OR always default as being treated first, or
does AND? Now, NOT generally is not the default first operator; in fact,
I don't think I've seen that as the default in any system I've used. But
OR and NOT are in different orders depending upon the system you're
using. And why that's important is because it can really change the
nature of how the system reads your search.
:::

## Operators: OR

![](images/paste-C5AED4AB.png){fig-align="center" width="5%"}

::: notes
Okay, so let's talk about each of these operators. The OR operator is
what we use to build up concepts. It's where we string together our
synonymous terms, or what we might call in indexing our equivalent
terms. It's also where we can put in spelling variants if truncation is
not possible in the system or if wildcards are not possible. A wildcard
is different from truncation.

A wildcard is when you insert a character, such as an asterisk or a
question mark, in the middle of a term, which tells the system "I want
you to look for all of the spelling variants for this particular term
that might replace this character." And in some systems, wildcards can
replace more than one character. It will look for all spelling variants.
We'll look at some examples of this in just a few minutes.

The EBSCO system has a really nice wildcard feature, where the ProQuest
system is not as useful. You also use the OR operator to put together
related terms. So, again, what you're doing with the OR operator is
you're building up those relationships between the different concepts,
the synonyms or equivalent terms, spelling variants, and related terms.
:::

## OR: How it Works

![](images/paste-794F4985.png)

![](images/paste-D82284AE.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

::: notes
How it works in the system--and this is something that confuses our
users--is that when you use OR, any documents that contain any of the
terms you've put together with the OR are going to be brought together
in your search set, in your result set.

So, generally when you use OR, it produces larger sets and more
documents. Okay, so you've got a set for 'information seeking OR
searching.'

So, every document in your system that has any of those
terms--'information,' 'seeking,' 'information seeking' or
'searching'--are going to come back into this large document set. Now
what does that say about precision and recall?
:::

## Operators: AND

![](images/paste-001728E4.png)

![](images/paste-C09779ED.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

::: notes
The operator AND works very differently. AND is where we combine those
concepts blocks or the words that we're using in our queries. And it
will only bring back documents that contain all of the words and all of
the concept blocks. So, what the system does is to produce a smaller
set, a more precise set, which includes fewer documents than our OR set
includes.

So, if we're looking for 'children AND information seeking' or
'information, seeking,' we're going to find only those documents that
include all of our terms, so that small set in the middle of the Venn
diagram is what's returned back to our users. Generally an AND search is
going to be more precise, but it's going to have lower recall.

So, if you had any documents that included 'adults' but did not include
'children,' they would not be part of the set. So, you have to think
about this potential limitation to the results when you're constructing
the query.
:::

## Operators: NOT

![](images/paste-BD0B9141.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

![](images/paste-7F1EB2F0.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

::: notes
Okay, the NOT operator is what we use to exclude words or concepts from
our set. You want to use NOT sparingly because it may limit your search
too much, okay? So, generally what you're going to want to do is start
out without using NOT, and then if you have way too many documents,
that's when you're going to start excluding words or concepts, okay?

It's only going to bring back documents that do not include those
excluded terms. It produces a smaller set, even smaller than the AND
set, with more specific documents--so higher precision and fewer
documents, so lower recall. And, again, it depends upon the goal for the
search. Do you need just really highly specific documents and few
documents, or do you need to find out everything on this topic, so you
want higher recall.

So, again, in our search 'information seeking,' 'information and
seeking' and 'NOT adults,' we're going to get back the white set in the
middle of the diagram. But if we're looking for documents that include
both 'adults AND children'--you know, we're looking for information
seeking of children--and we NOT out 'adults,' any documents that include
adults and children are not going to be returned in our search. So, you
need to use the NOT operator sparingly.

In a database, you're going to use the NOT operator to exclude the term,
in a Web search engine, you can simply insert a minus sign directly in
front of the word or phrase you want to NOT out, and supposedly, it will
be excluded from your document set. Or if you're using advanced search
on the Web, that's where you can tell the search engine "do not contain
these words or phrase," and then the system should exclude the word or
phrase from your set. But again, just a cautionary note, don't start
with NOT unless you're very sure about what you want back in your
document set.
:::

## Step 6: Choose Database(s)

-   Familiarize self with databases and combination of databases

    -   OU databases
        -   Scope/coverage
        -   Advanced Search pages, Thesauri, FAQs
        -   What search features, operators (Boolean, proximity), IR
            methods (stemming, stopword lists, etc.) are available for
            the database

::: notes
Now, I always waffle about where to put this step. Choosing databases is
one of the very important first steps we take when we're searching. You
need to choose the appropriate sources in which to conduct your
searches, or you're going to waste your time. You're going to come up
with items that are not relevant. You're going to become frustrated and
think your terms aren't working, and it's because you're in the wrong
database to begin with.

So, the first step to this, of course, is to take some time to
familiarize yourself with databases and different combinations of
databases. Now, OU's databases have been put together by different
vendors, so that all the EBSCO databases get searched in that large
federated search, which I dislike. Or you can pick and choose particular
databases by Resource by Subject or you can browse and search multiple
different databases, which I'll show you how to do in a few minutes.

But there are different ways you can determine your database. But this
is the class where you get to spend some time playing around with
different databases and exploring all those other databases that you
never really looked at before because they weren't library science
databases and you had no real reason to look at them. So, take some time
first to familiarize yourself with the different databases. OU has a
wonderful variety on multiple different topics that, of course, are
geared to help the users of this academic community, so they're focused
on the academic subject areas present at OU.

When you look at a database, you should try to determine the scope of
it, meaning--how many years are covered, what topics are covered, what's
not included, are there things that I can't find in this database that I
need to supplement with another database? You also then need to look at
the advanced and basic search pages and what can be done. See if there's
a thesaurus function--if you can search within a thesaurus and come up
with subject headings or controlled vocabulary terms instead of just key
words.

And then look at the FAQ pages to figure out what type of operators are
being used; can you use proximity operators, Boolean operators? Can you
use truncation? And if so, how do you do it? So look at those FAQ pages
and find out how to make your searches more precise. And then look at
the different types of search features--such as Boolean operators, the
IR methods, how is the system stemming your words, are there stop word
lists that the system uses, If so you don't want to use those words in
your searches.

Again, it's important that within a suite of databases you may have very
similar functionality, but you may not always have the same fields in a
system, you may not always have a thesaurus, and you may have a
different option--instead of a thesaurus, you may be able to browse
topics. So, again, familiarize yourself with the different databases
before you start searching. This exploration usually only takes a few
minutes; just click around and see what options are there and read the
FAQs. It will make your searches a lot more efficient.
:::

## Thesaurus/Help Page

![](images/paste-1F9FE076.png)

::: notes
Okay, so let's take a look at where we might find a thesaurus in one of
our suite of databases. This is the EBSCOhost page, advanced search
page, and I'm using Communication Source as the database because it has
some different options than what we might see in LIS databases. You
might take some time to compare those differences. The black arrow on
the left hand side of the screen shows you where to find the thesaurus
feature, and this particular system has one. And then also the arrow on
the right hand side of the screen is where your Help, or your FAQ, pages
are for this system.

You can also search by Publications--which we'll look at in a few
slides--and Images. And then also in that same bar there is a More
screen, which will take you into the Indexes and Images, and I'll show
you that in a minute. This screen shows the advanced search page, and
you can see you can choose by Boolean/ Phrase, "Find any of the terms,"
you can "Find any of the phrases", or "all of the terms". And there are
a lot of other options if you scroll on down the page to limit your
search as well to different publications, to document types, language,
date ranges, etc. that you should take advantage of if you have that
information.
:::

## Example of Thesaurus

![](images/paste-1AC98071.png)

::: notes
Okay, Let's explore the Thesaurus feature. To access the Thesaurus,
click on the Thesaurus link at the top red bar. I've just put in a
phrase you've all become very familiar with lately, 'Freedom of
Information.' And so, when I search this database, which is dealing with
journalism and communication in general as a discipline, freedom of
information is really important to journalists because they have to
verify the information on particular government activities, and one way
they do it is requesting information through the FOIA Act.

So, on this slide, I've clicked on the Freedom of Information choice
from the list of thesaurus terms. Each term contains a scope note--a
scope note is generally a definition of how this term is used in this
controlled vocabulary within this system, and it might be very different
in another system. So, it's important to read scope notes to make sure
that the term is really what you're looking for, that the concept is
what you need. There are also listed narrower terms and related terms.
And then there are some terms below that are in black by the "Used for,"
which are the non-authorized terms, meaning that they would not be used
to index the subjects in this database.

So, things like 'Information, Freedom of' would not be used as a subject
term in this system, okay. And then the other narrower terms and related
terms are other terms that you can add to your search simply by clicking
on the box next to it and then clicking the little "add," and then they
will automatically get added in the proper format to your search string.
Using the thesaurus feature is another way of digging out some
alternative terms, related terms, that you might not have thought about
when you were constructing your search. It's going to give you a larger
document set, more than likely, but it's going to be very much on point
because it's using the controlled vocabulary of this system.

The terms in the thesaurus are the subject headings used by indexers
when they created the database records for each article. Not every
system is going to have a thesaurus feature that you can use. And
oftentimes people don't use that thesaurus feature because one, they
don't see that it's a possibility and two, they don't know what it is
because this system isn't giving you any information about how to use it
or what it is used for. If you go into the FAQs it gives you a nice
description, but if somebody just accidentally clicked on that link, it
really wouldn't tell them very much. So, again, it's something I hope
you take a look at and explore. Controlled vocabulary searching, as I
said, is a way to get into the subject terms being used by this
particular system, and it can make for very precise searching.

## Thesaurus

![](images/paste-565D7DEC.png)

::: notes
This slide shows you an example of the ProQuest thesaurus, and I've used
the same term again, 'Freedom of Information,' and you can see that the
display is slightly different. The system is giving you all the Broader
terms first but no other related terms,
:::

## Thesaurus (Cont.)

![](images/paste-9B67B14F.png)

::: notes
And then you can click on those terms and they're automatically added to
your search or they expand out and give you even more choices. And then
it gives you 'Freedom of movement,' 'Freedom of religion,' etc., which,
of course, are just alphabetical listings of the terms in this
thesaurus.

On this slide, I've clicked on one of the terms 'First Amendment, United
States' because I wanted to drill down even further to see how that term
was being represented and what broader and narrower terms and related
terms I might want to consider for my search. So, the thesaurus serves
two purposes. One, it gets you into the subject terms that are used by
this system in the subject field to represent the concept, Freedom of
Information, okay? But it also gives you additional terms that you might
want to add to your query.

## Example of Topic Search

![](images/paste-490ACD8D.png)

::: notes
Okay, in ProQuest you have some additional features that you don't see
in EBSCO. And these can be very useful, but again, they take some time
to get used to and to learn how they're structured and what you can do
with them. You can select topics by the broad categories of Business &
Industry, Computers & Internet, Economics & Trade, Environment,
Government & Law, and Social Issues & Policy. You can play around and
see what you think about this feature. When you click on any of the
subtopics, you can view documents related to that topic, you can narrow
it by related topics, etc. So, it's another way in which you can get
into the system's structure as well as how they're representing
particular concepts.

## Results of Topic Search

![](images/paste-7C4374EA.png)

::: notes
And on this slide, I've just selected one of those subtopics so you can
see what the screen would look like. I selected the entry for
Information literacy. You can see all Related Searches at the top of the
screen, as well as click on "View All" to see all related searches. From
the pop up for "View All" you can choose other related searches to
pursue. If you scroll to the bottom of the screen, you will find the
option to "Search Within" that can also be very helpful when narrowing
down searches within the desired result set.

## Wildcard and Truncation

![](images/paste-C52279A4.png)

::: notes
Now let's talk about wildcard and truncation. Wildcard and truncation
are ways in which you can expand your search in different ways. With the
truncation symbol, you are telling the system to search the root of the
word and any other forms of the word that are present in the system. So,
a truncation search can be really helpful; however, you have to be
really careful not to truncate too far to the left. If you truncate too
far to the left, you're cutting off too much of the word and you might
end up with some really interesting results.

And each system has different truncation possibilities; some systems
don't allow truncation at all, but the majority of proprietary systems
nowadays do have some truncation function. For the EBSCO system you can
see on the screen here, it's giving you instructions that you use an
asterisk at the point, the root point of the word, that you want it to
search. So if we type C-O-M-P-U-T and put the asterisk there
('comput*'), it will look for 'computer,' 'computers,' 'computing'--any
form of the word that follows that root, okay? You can also use the
symbol here between words to match any word, and it gives you an example
there at the bottom. Use 'midsummer' and then '*dream' ('midsummer \*
dream') and it would include 'midsummer night's dream' in that search.

So, again, that's a useful way of conducting a truncation search. Now, a
wildcard is when you want to search for variants of spellings, say, or
different forms that are in the middle of a word, such as 'woman' or
'women.' You would use a wildcard symbol in the place of the letter. The
EBSCO database uses a question mark and a pound sign for wildcard. They
use the question mark to replace an unknown character. So, if there's a
word that you're not quite sure how you want to spell or you want to
spell it several different ways, then you're going to put the question
mark in.

If you want to use the number sign, that's where you're going to look
for alternate forms of the word, such as color. You would put in the
number sign after C-O-L-O-number sign-R ('colo#r'), then you'd get both
forms of that word; color with the 'or' and colour with the 'our'. So,
wildcard and truncation symbols, again, are useful in that you're
searching more than just one form or spelling of a word, and it allows
the computer instruction to look for more than just the root of a word.
:::

## Truncation and Wildcards

![](images/paste-95C54B8B.png)

::: notes
Slide 23 shows you the help screen for ProQuest related to wildcards and
truncation symbols to use in your searches. The two systems are quite
similar.
:::

## Proximity Searching

![](images/paste-5808C3C5.png)

::: notes
Another really nice feature is what's called proximity searching, and
every database that includes proximity searching generally has like an
'n' or a 'w' operator--'n' is a near operator, and 'w' is the within
operator. In EBSCO you can use both the near operator and the within
operator to limit your searches even further. For example, if you use
the near operator, that's where you want to find words that are within a
particular range of another word.

So, if we put in the word 'tax' and then 'n5,' meaning near within five
words of reform, it's going to look for every document that has 'tax'
and then there might be up to five intervening words in between the word
'reform.' With the w operator generally it finds words that are within
the particular range of one another; they don't have to be in a
particular order.

So, if you put in that same kind of search 'tax' within 5 of 'reform'
('tax w5 reform'), it's going to find anything that has 'tax' within
'reform' or 'reform' within 'tax.' So, there's no order imposed when
you're using the w operator. It depends upon the system itself as to how
those proximity operators work or even if they're an option. So, try
some proximity operators in your searches at some point and see what you
think. You can use proximity operators even within the Boolean search
strings as well.
:::

## Stopwords, Phrases, Punctuation

![](images/paste-DAF3708D.png)

::: notes
Additional aspects of searching that you need to learn a little bit
about in each system are stop words. Those are the words that really
have low value within a system because they're used so frequently that
the term has been stripped out of the indexing when indexing is
conducted by the system when the system creates the inverted indexes.
Also, you need to learn how to conduct phrase searches. Some systems use
either quotation marks, or you put your words, your concept, in a set of
parentheses. And then also you should look at how your particular system
is using punctuation. What is shown on this slide is EBSCO's Help for
"More Information on Stop Words, Quotation Marks, and Punctuation."
:::

## Nesting (Not Just for Birds!)

![](images/paste-D5D8399E.png)

::: notes
There's another concept that you can use in your searching and that's
called nesting, because it allows us to string together a lot of
concepts or concept blocks using multiple Boolean operators to conduct
really complex searches.

This screen on EBSCO Help tells us more about nesting and phrase
searching as well as Boolean operators and how they work, This system
calls them 'Booleans.' Nesting is when we put multiple concepts together
in parentheses and then we combine them using Boolean operators with
other concepts blocks.

So, if we had a search looking for computerized instruction, we could
use 'comput*' with a truncation, 'AND' and then within parentheses, we
could put 'instruction,' or 'instruct', 'educate,' 'online education' as
a phrase. You could construct a very complex search using nesting, and
EBSCO systems do allow you to use this form of searching. You can nest
using the Boolean operators as well, and so, you can really create some
complex searches within the advanced search pages such as comput* AND
(instruction OR instruct, educate, online education)
:::

## Indexes/Articles

![](images/paste-F3076007.png)

::: notes
Another nice feature that I like with EBSCO is that it allows you to get
into the indexes of your different systems. And EBSCO also lets you do
searches by the particular documents themselves, the publications, or
the articles. The way to get into the indexes is to click on the More
tab on the red bar, choose Indexes. I've just shown that on this slide.
:::

## Indexes

![](images/paste-6CB0D747.png)

::: notes
So, I've gone into the index for the Communication Source and then I've
selected the Browse tab. And you can see here different indexes created
by the system when it created the inverted indexes. This system has an
inverted index for Author, Author Supplied Keywords, Company, Document
Type, etc. When you search in a specific field, you're going to search
in the inverted index file. And this is our way that we can browse those
indexes.
:::

## Indexes/People

![](images/paste-5E4CEE28.png)

::: notes
On this slide, I am browsing the People index. You can simply browse the
whole index if you want to, which would be very inefficient, but you can
also enter the term into the search box. I've used 'Obama, Barack'. You
can see the number of records that have this term as an index term. You
could click on those and add them to your search. If you want to add
them as your search, you would click on the boxes for the different
index terms, and then click the Add button, and it would construct that
search for you.
:::

## Indexes/People

![](images/paste-26D7109C.png)

::: notes
Okay, so, on this screen you can see the search that the system
conducted. If you look at the very top left hand corner, you can see the
search box that's put all of my index terms that I have selected
together in a search. So, it should produce a set that includes all
those different alternatives.

Now, remember that what the inverted index does is it takes the words
out of that field in the database and it puts them into an alphabetical
index, so that when the system is searching that particular field,
that's what's being searched rather than every other word in every other
field of the system.

So, it makes your search a lot quicker, but it also makes it more
precise. So, what is happening when you're doing an index search
limiting by this method, is you're using the words that are in the
documents themselves and also in the indexing that the person who
indexed this database put together. So, it becomes a really precise
search.
:::

## Publication Search

![](images/paste-ED51F119.png)

::: notes
Both EBSCO and ProQuest also allow you to browse by publication, so if
you know the name of a particular publication, such as the 21st Century
Fuels; Oxford, you can click on that and go directly to it. Another nice
feature of the ProQuest system is that you can see that it's a full text
search and you can also see the range of years included within this
particular system for that publication. So, on this screen 21st Century
Fuels from Oxford is a full text document and it is for years 1995-1998.
So, this is one way you can check the scope of your database. You can
also see on this slide the many ways in which you can identify and limit
the Publications search.
:::

## Step 7: Begin Search

![](images/paste-79742CC0.png)

::: notes
Okay, now that we've explored some of the functionality of our two of
our large database vendors at OU, ProQuest and EBSCO--though, you know,
there are many, many more we could explore,--let's begin our search,
which is step seven. Usually, you should start with the most specific
word or concept block when you're doing a search. But again this will be
different depending upon whether you want high precision or high recall.

And so you're going to have to tweak that depending upon the
expectations for the search. If you use the most specific word or
concept block, it's generally an indication of how large a set you're
going to expect, okay? If you're using very broad terms, you're probably
going to get a larger set. If you're using very specific search terms or
concept blocks, you're going to get a smaller set. It's also a really
good indication of how effective your terms or your concept blocks are
in your search. You can take a look at each of your different searches
and see how effective your search has been.

Another strategy that some people use is they don't like to combine
their searches. So, they use the terms individually and then they
combine their search sets, and some systems will let you do that,
especially some of the EBSCO systems. You can go back into your search
history and chose those different sets and combine them into searches,
and you let the system do the combining for you. Generally what they're
doing is ORing your terms or your sets together, though, and that's not
necessarily what you want. So, some people like to start using terms
individually, and then some people like to combine them with Boolean
operators. Also, you want to determine if truncation is important in
your search or not and just be careful how much of the term you
truncate. Don't go too far to left; if you do, you might end up with
some very odd results. So, one thing to check is, if you're getting very
strange results or you're not getting what you're expecting, is how far
you truncated it or if you need to truncate.
:::

## Step 8: Review Results

![](images/paste-2B60F00C.png)

::: notes
Step eight is, of course, to review your results. You want to evaluate
your documents. You want to see how they're matching your terms or those
concepts blocks and determine if it's an appropriate match.

Or if it's an inappropriate match, what's going on? Why didn't it work?
Did some of the terms work? Did some terms not work? And then you want
to adjust your query accordingly.

You also at this point want to look at other terms that are in those
useful documents that you pull up. We call this pearl growing. This is
where you might look at the subject headings being used or the
controlled vocabulary terms in the indexing, and you might want to add
those to your searches, or you might want to construct different
searches using those terms.

Now the nice thing about systems like EBSCO and ProQuest is that
oftentimes you can link out to those different subject headings and
conduct that search right from your result page. But again, the problem
with that is that you might get lost and you need to go back to your
original search.

And sometimes depending upon how complicated your query is, that can be
a little frustrating, trying to get back where you were or to remember
what you've done, and that's where those search logs are really useful.

And if you do decide to link out to some of those other terms, you want
to make sure you note that down, so you can know where you've been. But
pearl growing is really useful, and even in library catalogs, it's a
really good way for our users to get closer to the concepts that we're
using in our cataloging. By clicking on the subject headings that are
used to index that document, they'll pull up even more documents that
are on the same topic.
:::

## Step 9: Revise and Refine Search

![](images/paste-5210E560.png){width="80%"}

::: notes
Step nine is where we want to revise and refine our search. You'll use
different strategies depending upon each individual search, the
functions of the system, and the degree of match between your terms and
the terms or the documents retrieved. So it's going to be different
depending on the results of your search.

But you're going to try some things, like alternative terms and
combinations. If you didn't want to nest all your terms at once, you can
go back and run different sets, as I mentioned, using alternative terms,
and then you can combine the successful sets together. And again, this
is based on your comfort level as to how complicated of a search you
wanted to construct.

But if one search term isn't working or a concept block isn't working,
then try to some alternative terms, try some synonymous terms, try some
broader, narrower, or related terms. Truncate further to the left is
another strategy you can use, but again, I always caution people about
this one because you can end up with some really strange things.

\
Drop concept sets. You know, if there's something's not working, get rid
of it. Generally, you want to get rid of the least specific first,
because it's generally giving you too broad of results. If you reviewed
your searches, you'll have a good understanding of why it worked or why
it didn't work. And then you can also add in new concept sets if there
are alternative concept sets you didn't use, or if you've rethought your
search and you've realized that I really should think about it this way
instead, then you can go back and add additional concept sets.

And you should always check for errors. If a search isn't working,
there's usually a reason. Spelling errors are something, especially with
younger users, that are really prevalent. Now a lot of our systems
correct our spelling for us, or like in Google, they'll say "Did you
mean this spelling?" But spelling still can be a problem in a lot of
systems, and even those spelling variants can be a problem as well.

You also want to check that your combinations are correct.

-   Are you constructing your Boolean search accurately, and then how is
    it being operated on by your system?

-   Is the OR the default or is the AND the default in that system?

-   So, think about how the systems are reading your search string, and
    is that how you want it to be read?
:::

## Step 9 (Cont.)

![](images/paste-613E837F.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

::: notes
Now, if you're getting too many documents, there's a potential problem
with your recall. You want to try to figure out which terms are useful.
You want to use fewer terms in your search, and you want to use narrower
terms in your search. But again, this is going to depend upon the
results produced. You have to evaluate what's going on in that search.
If you're getting wrong results, that means that your terms are not
being used within that system or even within the documents themselves if
you're doing full text searching.

So, you want to try alternative terms and different kinds of concept
combinations of terms, different kinds of Boolean combinations. Another
thing you might consider is get more information from your user. Go back
and talk to them some more. Say that you're not finding anything or
you're not finding anything useful, and can they give you some more
information? Another strategy, again, is to try some of the pearl
growing that I mentioned. If you can find some documents that are
relatively useful, do some pearl growing and use the system's terms to
find the subjects for you.

You can also go back into your thesaurus as I showed you earlier and use
controlled vocabulary terms from the system. Now, again, if you're using
controlled vocabulary terms, you are searching in the subject field, but
you're using the terms that the system has identified as the authorized
term for representing that concept. And controlled vocabulary searching
can be really powerful, but it also can be really precise. So, you have
to evaluate the results and see are you getting what you want, or is it
too restrictive? As with any type of searching there are pros and cons
with using controlled vocabulary as well.
:::

## Step 10: Remain Focused

![](images/paste-CD4FA4D0.png){width="90%"}

> REMEMBER: It is possible that there are no documents that match your
> needs in that particular source. Review the question and re-evaluate
> your choice of source. Should you change databases? Go onto the Web?
> Online resources are fairly comprehensive, but they do not contain
> everything.

::: notes
Lastly, and this is something that I have to tell myself even after how
many years of searching-- thirty plus years of conducting searches? Boy,
I'm really dating myself now. Anyway, step ten, remain focused. Always
stay focused; don't get off on false leads if at all possible.

That's why search logs can really help you. You'll know what terms and
searches you used in the past; you know what didn't work. You can
reorganize your searches; you can add new terms. You will have a record
of false leads. If you're going down the path where you're doing a lot
of pearl growing, make a note of it, so you know where you've been and
how to get back to where you started. This is a real problem when you
get on the Web too. You click around, and you access so many sites, you
don't know where you've been. Your search history is nice, but search
histories are limited on the Web.

Retrace your steps and review your past searches. Use your search logs
to determine where you've been. If you have a system like EBSCO where it
has a search history, you can see what you've done. You're not reviewing
the same results sets again, but you can at least see what queries
worked or didn't work.

Try new combinations of terms. Go back and think about the words that
you used to represent your concepts.

And this one is really important. Try other resources. You may be in a
database that's not appropriate for that search. You may be in a
resource that just doesn't have the kind of information you need to
answer that question. So, try other resources. And I always tell you to
step out of your comfort zone, but don't go too far. Make sure that the
system that you're using, the database you're using is useful for that
search. You don't just use Library and Information Science databases
because that's what you're familiar with and you think, "Oh, it should
be in there." The point is, be open to trying other sources that might
hold the information you are looking for.

But again, remain focused. If it's not working, try to figure out why.
Ask for more information. Try other resources. And when you use the Web,
make sure you're using terms that are going to be useful, and try some
advanced strategies that we talked about if your searches aren't
working. I hope this has given you some more information on how to
conduct searches, but also how to make your searches more efficient and
more precise.

Take some time to evaluate different databases. Look up their FAQs. The
nice thing about suites of databases is generally those functions work
through all of the system in the suite. Be sure you know which different
functions are available in the system you are using and that you
capitalize on the field structure when possible. Don't just assume that
each system is going to work exactly the same. I hope you will take some
time to check out some new systems you haven't looked at and explore
different ways of searching that may be new to you.
