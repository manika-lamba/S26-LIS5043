## We are Data (Cont.) {.smaller}

#### [***We live in a world of ubiquitous networked communication***]{style="color: blue;"}

-   technologies that constituent the Internet are so woven into the fabric of our daily lives, where for most of us, existing without seems unimaginable

#### [***We also live in a world of ubiquitous surveillance***]{style="color: blue;"}

-   same technologies have helped spawn an impressive network of governmental, commercial, and unaffiliated infrastructures of mass observation and control
-   most of what we do in this world has at least the **capacity** to be *observed, recorded, analyzed, and stored* in a databank
    -   HOW?
        -   storage is cheap
        -   computers are fast to analyze information in both real time & retrospective
        -   our daily activities that are mediated with software can be easily configured to record and report everything it sees upstream

So on the one hand, we live in a world of ubiquitous networked communication. Internet technologies are so deeply embedded in everyday life that, for many of us, it’s hard to imagine functioning without them. From messaging and email to navigation, learning, shopping, and entertainment, these systems quietly support almost everything we do.

At the same time, we also live in a world of ubiquitous surveillance. The very same technologies that enable connection and convenience also support extensive systems of observation and control. These systems are not limited to governments—they include commercial platforms and other organizations that collect data for a wide range of purposes.

What’s especially important here is capacity. Even if someone is not actively watching at every moment, most of our actions have the potential to be observed, recorded, analyzed, and stored in databases. That possibility is built into the infrastructure itself.

So how does this become possible? 

First, data storage is relatively cheap, which means there’s little incentive to delete information. Second, computers are fast enough to analyze massive amounts of data, both in real time and after the fact. And third, many of our daily activities are mediated through software—apps, platforms, and digital systems that can be easily configured to log, track, and report everything they register upstream.

This slide invites us to think critically about how everyday convenience is intertwined with systems of data collection, and how surveillance becomes normalized as part of ordinary digital life.

#### [***We call people 'terrorists' based on metadata***]{style="color: blue;"}*; [**We kill people based on metadata**]{style="color: blue;"}*

-   data-based attack is a *'signature strike'*

    -   a strike that requires no *'target identification'* but rather an identification of groups of men who bear certain signatures or defining characteristics associated with terrorists activity but whose identities are unknown

-   US drone program in early 2000s, strikes were *"targeted"*

-   US does not publicly differentiate between its *"targeted"* and *"signature"* strikes

    -   shift in spike in frequency of drone attacks from 49 between 2004 and 2008 to 372 between 2009 and 2015

This slide is meant to help us understand `how powerful metadata can be`, even though it often feels invisible or abstract. Metadata is not the content of a message -- it’s information *about* the data, such as who communicated with whom, when, how often, where someone traveled, or which devices were used. What this slide shows is that decisions about people can be made `without knowing who they actually are`, based only on patterns in their metadata.

One example of this is something called a `“signature strike.”` In this type of attack, a specific person does not need to be identified by name. Instead, decisions are based on **patterns of behavior** that match a predefined profile thought to indicate terrorist activity. For example, a group of people might be targeted because their movements, communications, or locations resemble past patterns associated with militants, even if their individual identities are unknown.

Earlier U.S. drone strikes were described as “targeted strikes,” meaning they focused on known individuals. Over time, however, there was a shift toward ``signature strikes", where metadata patterns became enough to justify action. The U.S. government does not clearly distinguish between these two types in public reporting, which makes it harder to evaluate how decisions are made.

What’s important for us to understand is the `scale of this change`. Drone strikes increased dramatically from 49 between 2004 and 2008 to 372 between 2009 and 2015. This increase shows how relying on metadata and automated pattern recognition can lead to faster, broader decisions.

**Metadata represents people**, even though it doesn’t capture who they truly are. When metadata is treated as truth, mistakes, biases, or incomplete patterns can have serious consequences. This is why understanding metadata not only in contexts from printed material but digitally too and managing it responsibly, is such an important part of data stewards.
