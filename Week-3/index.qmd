# Introduction

::: notes
This week, we're going to talk about users and information seeking
behavior. This becomes very important to us: one, as someone who's
helping users find information in retrieval systems, but also for those
that design information systems and databases that help users connect
with information.

In this multi-lecture topic, we will first talk about users and their
information behavior broadly, but also why it is important that we
understand users to provide them with better organized collections and
organization systems.

Next week in part 1, we will learn more about information retrieval and
user-centered design and how these both relate to information
organization and users.

Next week in part 2, which is an optional lecture, I will introduce you to
some tips and advanced search techniques to use in information retrieval
systems, like OU Libraries' databases.
:::

## Important Questions

1.  `Who are Users?`

2.  `What can we know about Users?`

3.  `How do users seek and search for information?`

    Examples of models for search and information seeking behavior

::: notes
So let's talk about our users. Some questions to frame our thinking:

-   Who are our users?
-   What can we know about users?
-   How do users seek and search for information?

We will also look at some different models that have been developed in
Library and Information Science \[LIS\] through the years, primarily
starting in the 1980s about how users look for information. So, these
are some questions to help frame our thinking. Let's talk about each of
these aspects individually.
:::

## Who Are Users?

> A user is a person who uses information and/or information systems in
> some meaningful way

::: notes
First, let's look at "Who are our users?"

A user, very broadly defined, is "a person who uses information and/ or
information systems in some meaningful way."

Now, meaningful is a very subjective term, and you're thinking "what
does she mean by meaningful?"

And generally, it's up to the user to decide if their interaction with
the system has been useful.

Now, I'm not just talking about automated systems, technical systems.
I'm talking about systems in general.

You know, walking into the library and talking to a reference librarian
would be part of a system's interaction. I'll explain that in just a few
minutes, but users are anyone that really uses our system to find what
they're looking for, to solve an information need. And there are lots of
different terms that you're going to see in the literature that refer to
users.

In the 80's and the 90's we've called them "patrons" and "end users" and
"system users". We used to refer to librarians, specifically reference
librarians, as search intermediaries, so you might see that in the
literature, but that was primarily in the late 80's and early 90's. But
now we just call them users.

*[`Click Next` to view the pictures]*

Okay, so who exactly is today's user?

I've given you some pictures on this slide to think through what a user
or who a user is, but one thing that you'll notice, of course, is that
there is either a computerized or virtual or a print based technology in
place in each of these pictures.

You will notice, computers, much of what you would see in most of the
libraries today with various different people of different genders or
ages accessing the Internet or using computer systems within their
library context.

You also have to think about users in terms of age groups. We have young
users that are interacting with and adapting technology in ways that we
did not anticipate, which is very exciting for us as library and
information professionals, but it's also very challenging because we now
have to think about how do we engage with the users and help them become
better information consumers as well as creators of information.

And we cannot forget that people still like to browse our libraries.
People traditionally are used to going through the stacks, finding
something they like and then looking at the books around the book to
determine if there's something else that they find of interest or that's
related to their information need. So, classification systems are still
very relevant in libraries. That's not to say that the systems in place
are the best systems or the most user-friendly systems for this new
generation of user, but they do still support users in very important
ways.

A really interesting dimension of users, and this came about, of course,
with the Internet and more social ways of sharing information or
participating in online communities, is what is being called "citizen
science".

Also, we have very wired individuals as users today where a user is
connected to internet 24/7. These users are using different tools like
smartphones or tablets in ways that allow them to access information but
also to share and create information and engage in different practices
with other users. These are all dimensions of users we as information
professionals have to think about.
:::

## Model of Today's User

`Work in Progress?!`

::: notes
So, when we think about today's users, it's really difficult to model
the user today because of all the different technology that they
interact with on a daily basis and all the different resources they have
available to them at their fingertips.

So, let's think about the user as a "work in progress" as we work
through this lecture on users and information behavior.
:::

## Some More Vocabulary

-   `Information`: any difference you perceive in your environment or
    within yourself
-   `Information need`: recognition that your knowledge is inadequate to
    satisfy a goal you have
-   `Information seeking`: conscious effort to acquire information in
    response to a need or gap in your knowledge
-   `Information behavior`: information seeking, as well as other
    unintentional or passive behaviors, or other purposive behaviors
    such as avoiding information

::: notes
Some other vocabulary that might be useful for understanding this
dimension of information seeking and organization of information.

In this program you will read lots of definitions of **information**.
One definition I find particularly useful is: *information is any
difference you perceive in your environment or within yourself*.

So, we can think of information in lots of different ways. We can think
of it as a cognitive change that comes about when we learn something new
or we encounter some new piece of information. We can think of
"information-as-thing," or as physical objects actually being thought of
as information bearing Or having the ability to inform us in some way.
So, there are lots of different ways we can think of information.

**Information need** then is that recognition that you have that your
knowledge is somewhat inadequate in a particular area and you need to
find something else out in order to satisfy a goal that you have. For
example, if you want to learn about designing webpages, you're probably
going to go to a class, or you're going to find a book that will help
you with this, or you might even go on the web and find different
information. But you're going to access systems, resources, in order to
find information to solve your information problem.

Another term is **information seeking**, and this is a conscious effort
to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge.
Think about your daily activities. Many of you probably got up this
morning, turned on a computer or tablet, turned on the television,
listened to the news, got information about the weather, so you could
decide what you're going to wear today or if you need an umbrella. You
probably have talked on the phone to someone today. At different points
during your day, you have been encountering or accessing different
systems to find information.

**Information behavior**, then, is kind of this overall umbrella of
information seeking as well as other unintentional or passive behaviors
or other purposeful behaviors related to seeking (or not seeking)
information, such as avoiding information.

Now, how many of you have heard of cognitive dissonance? It comes from
cognitive science. Cognitive dissonance is where you avoid information
that you know is going to change something that you've already made a
decision about or something that you've already done and you don't
really want to encounter that information because you know it's going to
make you feel bad about your decision. That's just one way of looking at
it. So, for example, you've just made a major purchase, like you bought
a new car. And then you get on the website or you hear consumer reports
or something telling you how bad that car is and that you really
shouldn't have bought it in the first place, and that's the idea of
avoiding information.

Also, it's interesting in our field because of what we call the
information glut, or the information overload. That people purposely
filter our information sources in their lives because they don't want to
be overwhelmed with all this different kinds of information. For
instance, I don't turn on the news before 8:00 because I don't want to
know what's going on until I'm ready for it.

But that's one way in which we avoid information. Turning off the radio
while you're driving, things like that. When we look at information
behavior, we look at not just purposeful information seeking, but we
look at avoidance activities as well.

So, it's a really interesting area of our field that tells us a lot
about people and how our information can be represented for them in
order to effect access to that information.

So, what do we need to know about the people we call our users?
:::

## What do We Need to Know?

-   `Demographics`
-   `Types & Levels of Knowledge`
-   `Information-Seeking Situations`

::: notes
Well, there are certain things we can know, and there are certain things
we can make some generalizations about, such as demographics, types and
levels of knowledge, and information seeking situations. Let's address
each of these separately.
:::

## Demographics

-   `Age`
-   `Gender`
-   `Education`
-   `Occupation`
-   `Culture` *(values, language, ethnicity)*

::: notes
**Age** is one way that we can get a good picture about a user group.
And we can characterize age in many different ways. Our society has
created these frameworks in order for us to do so. We can think about
age in terms of K-5, K-12, young adult, adult, senior citizen, children.
We put all these different labels on it. So, that's one way in which we
can get a handle on one characteristic of our user group.

Also, **gender**, are they primarily males and females? In earlier
studies of computer adoption studies this demographic was a real factor.
It's not as much today as it used to be, but again there are still
studies that show that males are heavier users of different kinds of
information technology than females are, but that's shifting.

What's really interesting about some of our studies today with gender is
that we're seeing that particularly in the web and in the internet
environment is that we have different uses -- that each gender has a
different use. Females tend to use more of the communicative aspects of
the web and internet than males. And males generally -- and I don't like
to generalize, but studies have shown this -- are more into the
information gathering and gaming and more of the high tech applications.

So it's kind of interesting what we can tell about a user population
based on the different variables. But this is shifting constantly.

**Education** can tell us a lot about a user group. It tells us about
their potential knowledge, about their subject and domain expertise; it
tells us about potential uses they might have for that information that
they're looking for. So, education level can tell us quite a bit.

**Occupation** is the same. If we know that someone is an engineer or
chemist or a contractor or a builder, they're going to have a different
knowledge base potentially. And so it's interesting to be able to tell
what their occupation is because that again will tell us something again
about what they're going to be looking for, what kind of resources would
be useful for them.

**Culture** is a little bit of a grayer area. But it does tell us a
little bit about values and ethnicity and ethnic choices that people
make. But also language. Especially if you're designing a system. You
need to know what kind of language or what languages your users need in
order to access your system. Is it a multilingual system? Do you have a
very heavy multilingual population, and how do we adapt that within the
system environment? So, even language can be a very important variable
to know about our users. We have a sparsity of studies related to
cultural aspects of information behavior and users.
:::

## Types and Levels of Knowledge

[Allen (1991)](https://archive.org/details/informationtasks0000alle)

-   `World Knowledge`
-   `System Knowledge`
-   `Task Knowledge`
-   `Domain Knowledge`

::: notes
The second set of information that we can know about our users is what
we call "types and levels of knowledge":

-   world knowledge
-   system knowledge
-   task knowledge
-   domain knowledge

And others have expanded on this idea as well. So, let's break them each
down.
:::

## 1. World Knowledge

-   `World View, Perception of Self`

-   `Affects Self-Confidence`

::: notes
Now, we can look at them separately, but you can also see the
connections and the overlap between all these types of levels of
knowledge.

For example, **world knowledge** is a user's perception of themself and
the role that they play in the world -- in their own world. And it's
really a combination of the other three knowledge rolled into one. This
is kind of from a constructivist learning point of view -- that you
build or construct your own world based upon what you encounter, what's
in your society, and that frames and shapes your perception of yourself
and the role that you play.

Why this is important to us is that it will affect a user's
self-confidence when they're working with a particular system, when
they're looking for information, when they're coming to the reference
desk and asking questions. So, somebody with high world knowledge,
someone who has traveled a lot, someone who has a real broad view of the
world and different pieces of the world, and has a good sense of how
they *fit* in the world, is probably a more confident user of
information and information sources.
:::

## 2. System Knowledge

-   `Understanding of Information Environment`

> Information systems at some level (e.g. cultural, institutional,
> technical, interpersonal)

-   `Affects Skills and Expections`

::: notes
The second type of knowledge is a little bit more complex. This is
**system knowledge**, and this has been expanded upon by many people in
our field.

For example, Allen defines it as the understanding a user has of an
information environment. And this can mean many different things. This
can be an information system at any level -- not just a technical level.
It can be a cultural level -- how their community system works. Who do
you call if you need to find out if they're picking up your garbage on a
holiday? That's an example of your cultural system. An institutional
system would be something you know, "Who do I call if someone's put a
lock on my car wheel, so I can go home?" But you have to understand how
that institutional system might work.

Technical is related to knowledge of how the technical system works,
such as, "How does this database work? What can I do to make my search
effective?"

Interpersonal systems are your personal network. Who do you call if you
need a recipe for coffee cake? So, your own personal network, your
friends, your family, your colleagues.

Your understanding of system knowledge affects your skills and your
expectations when you're using different systems.

Okay, now let's expand this even further.
:::

## 2. System Knowledge (Cont.)

-   Conceptual knowledge of the information retrieval process - -
    *translating a need into a query*

-   Semantic knowledge of how to implement a query in a given system - -
    *the how and when to use the system features*

-   Technical skills in executing the query [(Borgman,
    1996)](https://escholarship.org/content/qt3mz7h8hr/qt3mz7h8hr_noSplash_36344d4ac812b2c94219b90e4a164074.pdf?t=p7cad8)

    -   basic computing skills
    -   syntatic knowledge of query entry and how search statements,
        systems work

::: notes
System knowledge includes many different aspects.

We can think of it as conceptual knowledge, we can think of it as
semantic knowledge, and we can think of it as technical skills. These
ideas were introduced by Christine Borgman in 1996 and they still hold
true today. Let's define each.

**Conceptual knowledge** is your understanding of an information
retrieval process -- translating your need into a query and eventually
implementing into a system.

**Semantic knowledge** is your understanding about how to implement a
query into a specific system -- or how do you input your query into a
given system. And how and when to use different system features.

For example, technical skills in inputting the query: your basic
computing skills, the syntax that you need in order to actually enter it
into the search box. Now, today we have it a little easier; we don't
have to use any command line searching. We don't have to put into our
OPACS anymore "A:\\" (A colon backslash) and then the author's last
name. And in most system's we don't even need to know if we need to
enter the last name, first name anymore. We've gotten very spoiled in
that way. But there are still a lot of systems out there that you really
have to know the syntax in order to enter a query to make the system
understand it.
:::

## 2.1 Conceptual Knowledge {.smaller}

-   Going from the vaguely-felt need...
    -   To the query formulation
        -   verbally expressed
        -   written or typed
-   Query is formulated in terms of the... (Buckland, 1991)
    -   Content *(words, numbers, symbols)*
    -   Information Entities *(documents, objects)*
    -   "Information as Thing" *(container of information)*
-   Successful query = translation of intended meaning into search terms

::: notes
Let's look at **conceptual knowledge**. Going from a vaguely felt need,
where we start to realize that we need some information about this
particular topic and "how can I find that information" to the idea of
expressing that query, either verbally where you go and ask somebody.

You ask a reference librarian, call someone on the phone, text somebody
on your phone, or type it into a search engine, type it into a database,
type it into an OPAC. We then have to understand how to formulate that
query within our system. We have to be able to take our actual query and
put it into terms that would be useful and meaningful to either a human
or a computerized system.

And oftentimes, I'm sure as you'll learn in 5053, your user doesn't
really know what they want when they come to talk to you. When they ask
you a question at a reference desk, they'll give you a really big ,
broad question, when they really need this other subset of that actual
query. After many years at a reference desk, I can tell you, you get
everything from A - Z.

And oftentimes, you start very broadly and eventually you drill down to
what they need. But again, a user often has to go through that same
process when they're seeking information.
:::

## 2.2 Semantic Knowledge

-   `How to Implement a Query in the System`
-   `How the System is Structured` *(file system used)*
-   `Action` *(find, select, scan, browse)*
-   `Access Points or Field Tags` *(author, title, subject)*
-   `Search Terms` *(search functions of systesm: Boolean, Keyword)*
-   `How the Search Results are Displayed`

::: notes
**Semantic knowledge** is again how to implement a query into a system.
You have to know how that system is structured - what kinds of fields
are in that system, what fields are searchable within a system, and the
kinds of information that they would hold within those fields.

You have to know the different actions that are possible such as which
fields are searchable and how to limit your query to specific field(s)
in the system you are using. Other aspects include, for example, how we
enter our search terms. What terms work, and as I said earlier, what
kind of functions are possible in the system? Do you have to use an AND
or a NOT Boolean string in order to make your search work, or can you
just do fielded searching? Or if you're in a search engine, do you just
put a couple of terms into the magical box and see what you get?

You also have to know how the search results are displayed, and it's not
as difficult in some of the systems today, but remember in older
systems, we had all those function keys across the top? And if you hit
F1, you could print. If you hit F3, you could get a full - screen
preview. Things like that. Our users again are a little more spoiled
than when we were learning different systems, but still, they have to
understand the different functionalities of a system. And if the system
isn't well - designed - if the navigation is difficult, or there are a
lot of necessary or unnecessary features that are not easily
accessible - then our users are also not going to be able to use our
systems.
:::

## 2.3 Technical Skills

-   We MUST not take for granted that all users know how to use
    computers
-   How the computer operates
-   Syntax of entering search commands
-   Commands to manipulate system [(Borgman,
    1996)](https://escholarship.org/content/qt3mz7h8hr/qt3mz7h8hr_noSplash_36344d4ac812b2c94219b90e4a164074.pdf?t=p7cad8)
    -   control search
    -   display formats
    -   control output of results

::: notes
Technical skills - is the second aspect of System Knowledge.

We cannot take for granted that all our users know how to use computers.
Even in today's very highly wired web environment. Not all our users are
online. And not all of our users are proficient searchers. We, then,
can't take for granted some of the basic functions of a computer, such
as how a keyboard works.

Have you all heard the tech support story about the person that calls up
and says, "Well, it says to hit the 'any key,' but I can't find it on my
keyboard. Where's 'any key'?" We still get stories like that. Or the one
where the people were so happy because their new computer came with a
cup holder - the CD drive? Thought it was for holding cups? Or even the
one about the mouse, where they tried to access their computer by
pointing their mouse at the screen? Or putting it down on the floor like
a presser foot for a sewing machine?

These are true stories, and we still get them.

So, we can't make assumptions that everyone understands how to use our
systems.

Users base their use of systems on previous experience they have had.
For example, an older user may be familiar with a presser foot when she
used a sewing machine so her mental model of how to use the mouse may be
based on this prior experience.

And as you all know, when you're learing new databases, you first have
to navigate a little bit. You have to look and see which kinds of fields
are searchable, if it includes Boolean searches or not, if there's any
kind of proximity operators you can use to make your queries more
precise.

Everyone has to go through the same kind of process whenever you start
using a new system. So, they may not understand how the computer itself
works, they may not know how to enter the query, and they may not know
the different commands to make the system do what they need.

And, honestly, even though these are really interesting , fun stories,
we also need to remember that our users don't have the background that
we all do. They're not all from a library science program, where this is
what we learn. This is what we're here for, is to learn how to connect
our users with information.
:::

## 3. Task Knowledge

-   `Understanding of Information Problem and Use`
-   `Affects Motivation and Goals`

::: notes
The third type of knowledge is what we call **"task knowledge,"** and
this is one of the primary areas after domain knowledge that's really
essential to know about your users.

Task knowledge is an understanding a person has of their information
problem and use - how well your users understand what they need, what
they're looking for and how well they understand the kind of resources
they might need to use to find that information.

So, if we say that a user has high task knowledge, that means that they
understand very well what the query is that they have.

They want to wallpaper their kitchen, so they know that they want some
kind of book that tells them about home decoration. That's a really
pretty good understanding of their task.

But say that they need to know about the ordinances in your city if they
want to build a house with a pitched roof. Where do you go for that kind
of information? To the city ordinances, or your planning department, but
this is not the kind of information every user will know.

But your users have to have a good understanding of the task itself and
the kind of resources that they need to answer that query. And they also
need to know how well your collection can help them answer that query.
And this really affects our user's motivation and goal. If they can't
easily figure out what they need, oftentimes, they will not go any
further. They will leave the library or library website unsatisfied and
go to another source, such as a search engine.
:::

## 4. Domain Knowledge

-   `Understanding of Topic and Topic Organization`
-   `Affects Ability to Exploit Language and Association`

::: notes
The last area, and this is probably the most important, of the four
types of knowledge, is called **"domain knowledge."** This is our user's
understanding of the topic and the topic organization or the discipline
of the topic and how that discipline is structured. So, for example, if
you're an undergraduate chemistry student, how well at that point do you
understand the discipline of chemistry? Probably you have a fairly basic
understanding, but not at the same level as your professor or not at the
same level as graduate students in the discipline.

This type of knowledge is important for us to know because if a user has
a low or a high domain knowledge, it gives us an understanding of their
ability or facility to use the language of that discipline. And when
we're creating representations, we would make a decision to use very
specific terminology or to use more general terminology based upon what
we understand about their domain knowledge.

So, for example, if we're working with, again, a chemistry database,
we're assuming that our users are individuals that are in a program of
chemistry - they're either students or faculty - and we have varying
levels of domain knowledge. The students probably have a low to moderate
level of domain knowledge, whereas the faculty would probably have a
higher level.
:::

## Example

`Collection`: Law Firm Library

`Demographics`: First Yer Law Clerks

`Information-Seeking Situations`: State Statute on Environmental
Easements

`Types and Levels of Knowledge`: World, System, Task, Domain

::: notes
Here's an example on how we can apply what we've just been talking
about.

Our collection is a law firm library. The demographics, we have first
year law clerks, so they've probably been to law school for one year.
They're beginning to know the language of their discipline; they're
beginning to know how to conduct research in the areas. They've probably
taken at least one legal research class. They're beginning to understand
how to find information for their particular information needs.

Our situation here is that they need to find information on a state
statute on what are called environmental easements, which is a law that
tells you, for example, can you have a pitched roof, or how close can
you build to the water on a beach. An easement is a stipulation of
ownership and ownership building rights in a particular tract of land,
whether you own it, or if the government owns it.

So, this is our situation. We have the law clerks; they probably have a
pretty good idea of how to go about finding out this information. They
probably have a probably moderate domain knowledge - moderate to low.
Their system knowledge will vary depending upon the systems they have
used. And their task knowledge is probably moderate to low at this point
because they may not even know what an environmental easement is at that
stage in their education, but again it may vary as well.

Now, if we take the same situation and we put it in a public library ,
our users are going to change. We're probably not going to have law
clerks; we're going to have a person who wants to build on the beach.
And they need to know how close they're allowed to build close to the
dunes, for example. They're probably not going to have a clue what an
environmental easement is or even what a state statute is - very
possible. And so their task knowledge is going to be lower, their domain
knowledge is going to be lower, system knowledge depends on their
experience, but all of those are going to affect how they go about
looking for information, the questions they ask you, the resources they
access and how they interact with different systems.

Okay, so can you see how those types and levels of knowledge and
demographics can change what we need to provide in terms of access?

In a library - a public library - our records- our representations - are
probably going to be at a very general level. We're going to have one
card in our catalog that represents our set of state statues if we're
fortunate enough to have them in a public library, which will have very
general subject headings. Now, in a law firm library, we're probably
going to have a breakdown of the different volumes of the state statute
set that tells us what's in each individual volume. But the language in
our law firm collection is going to be at a higher level of what we call
of specificity - more specific terminology in use - than what we might
see in a public library.

So, the choices we make when we're designing and creating
representations will be different depending upon the environment,
depending upon the users, and their four types and levels of knowledge.
That's why types and levels of knowledge are so important to your
understanding of organizing information.
:::

## How Do User Seek and Search for Information?

Users are motivated to seek information in a given situation to: 

- `answer a question` 

- `solve a problem` 

- `complete a task` 

- `learn about a subject` 

- `verify a fact`

::: notes
Alright, now let's talk about our next framing question: How do users
seek and search for information?

As I've mentioned, there are lots of different models that we've
developed, as we've looked at information seeking from lots of different
perspectives.

Users are motivated for many different reasons to seek information:

-   to answer a question;
-   to solve a problem;
-   to complete a task;
-   to learn about a subject;
-   to verify a fact; and

many others I'm sure that you can think of!
:::

## How Do Users Seek & Search for Information?

Two Situational Levels

1.  `Information Seeking`
    
    Broad context involving any or all systems or sources accessed

2.  `Information Searching`

     Narrow context involving interaction with specific system or
        source

::: notes
We can look at this also from two situational levels: (i) **information
seeking** and (ii) **information searching**. And oftentimes in the
literature, these two get used interchangeably, but they're really not
the same.

**Information seeking** is kind of a broader context where we look at an
individual's entire information seeking activities - from all the
different systems that they use, from the beginning of their search to
the end of their search and the use of the information. That would be
seeking.

**Searching** is a more narrow context where we look at one specific
interaction with either a human system, a computerized system, any of
those other forms of systems that we discussed earlier. So, information
seeking is a broader context; information search is where we're looking
at a specific narrow situation.
:::

## What is Information Seeking?

>It refers to the [user's process for obtaining information]{style="color: blue;"}, from recognition of an information
need through use of information to resolve the information need

::: notes
So, what is information seeking? Let's go back to that idea.

The information seeking is the whole process of user recognizing their
information need -- that they have a gap in their knowledge, to
obtaining the information itself -- that they need to know something
about a particular topic through the use of different systems.
:::

## Information Seeking: Assumptions

Common assumptions about information seeking in LIS are that the process
is:

1.  `Purposeful`
2.  `Cognitive`
3.  `Contextual`
4.  `Value-Based`
5.  `Dynamic`

::: notes
Now in our field, as well as other fields, we've made some different
assumptions about information seeking and the process itself - that it's
purposeful (that we're always looking for information for a purpose).

Now, we're changing our idea about this because of the web. A lot of
people just get online and surf around. And actually, we've always been
not just for a specific purpose when we look for information. You go to
the library and you just browse the 'new book' shelf. You want to see
what's been published. You're not necessarily looking for anything in
particular . Maybe the purpose is to find something to read, but it's
not necessarily linked to a specific information need.

We've also assumed that it's a *cognitive activity* - that we're always
learning as we encounter information.

That it's *contextual* and that your need will change depending on the
different context.

And actually, that it's very *dynamic*. That as you learn more about a
particular subject when you're searching, your need will change because
you might because more focused, or you might become even broader. You
might go to a particular library OPAC looking for a particular subject
and then you find other subjects that are really interesting and you go
off on more of a non - focused track. Or you find a sub - piece of that
topic, and that is really where you want to focus. So, your need is
changing as well as you go into the information seeking process.

And *context* is important because that will impact the way that you
make decisions.

For example, if you need to do some research for your research paper and
it's due in three months, right now you'll use the web, you'll maybe use
an OPAC. You might even interlibrary loan something - a novel idea. You
can still do that. But say you have three days to get your paper in,
you're going to go to the web, you're going to access anything you can
quickly access, you're not going to interlibrary loan - you don't have
time for it now - and you're probably going to take anything that is
related to the topic that you're working on.

Your idea of what's relevant or useful to you changes because of the
context!

## Information Seeking & Searching: Models {.smaller}

-   `Motivation`: [why users seek information, their information
    needs]{style="color: orange;"}

    -   Mann's Library Research Models
-   `Interaction`: [how users interact with information systems and the
    process(es) they use]{style="color: orange;"}

::: notes
We've also framed information seeking through four basic different
frameworks: *motivation, situation, resources, and interaction*.

For example, *motivational models* look at why users seek information.
And what are their information needs. And how does this make each
information seeking situation different? The two most prominent models
in this area are Dervin's sense - making model and Belkin's anomalous
state of knowledge (ASK).

Dervin's sense - making model is one that's primarily a constructivist
point of view, where, and also it's been referred to as kind of a 'Star
Wars point of view,' in that she says that as we move through the world
in our daily lives and we encounter different stimulus from different
environments, we have a cognitive shift where we learn something new
about the particular topic or our world around us.

And when we're seeking information, we then have to be able to make
sense of that information and fit it into our cognitive frameworks. And
once we can do that, then it becomes useful to us. But again, when is
that point? And what do we have to do to get there? Her model's a lot
more complex than that, and it's really a very interesting model to
study. But again, it's more of a constructivist point of view, where we
learn from and construct new realities for ourselves based upon the
information we encounter in our daily lives.

Belkin's anomalous state of knowledge, or the ASK model, is where we
perceive some 'gap' in our knowledge - base and we look for information,
we use different systems in order to fill that gap. It's a little bit
more straightforward, but it's more of a process model from, again,
where we recognize we have a gap and everything we do in the meantime is
to find the information. Now, Belkin and Dervin have studied various
different populations, primarily adults, and their models, again, reveal
different patterns and information to us about how users look for
information, the different kinds of sources they use, and how they
interact with different systems.

*Situational models* look at how users seek information. What do they
actually do ? Kuhlthau's model, one of the most well known situational
models, has *affective* variables to it as well. Her research has
primarily been with middle and high school students.

We also have *resource models*. Thomas Mann who was the Librarian of the
Library of Congress developed these models through watching people over
the years and interacting with different people.

We have also *interaction models* - how users interact with information
systems. For example, "how we use a particular database, how we use the
web, or what systems do we actually use when we go to look for
information."

It is important to remember that each of these different frameworks and
models has been developed through the years with different groups of
users - from adults to children to elderly, to what we call 'naive
users' to more experienced users, to web users, to database users, to
OPAC users.

We've put lots of different labels on our user - groups, but we've
developed these models on about forty years of research now in various
different aspects of our field.
:::

## Kuhlthau's ISP Model

`Task Initiation: Recognize Information Need`

1.  [Topic Selection]{style="color: orange;"}: identify general topic
2.  [Prefocus Formulation]{style="color: orange;"}: investigate
    information on general topic
3.  [Focus Formulation]{style="color: orange;"}: decide on narrower
    topic
4.  [Information Collection]{style="color: orange;"}: gather information
    on narrower topic
5.  [Search Closure]{style="color: orange;"}: complete the search
6.  [Use of Information]{style="color: orange;"}: making use of
    information

::: notes
Kuhlthau's model, for example, is probably the most well - known and the
most well - used in our field. She has kind of a somewhat linear
approach, where we have a topic selection at the beginning, where you
identify a general topic. Remember most of her research was with
middle - and high - school students. The youth are looking for
information for a research project or a research paper.

The first stage is topic selection.

The second stage is called 'prefocus formulation' where the users do
some investigation on the general topic. They start looking at databases
and encyclopedias. They start looking in their card catalogs to find
information in their libraries about that topic - or now online.

The third stage is what Kuhlthau calls 'focus formulation,' where users
decide on a narrower topic from that general topic that they started
from. Kuhlthau links users' affective states to each of these different
stages - affective meaning different emotional responses or feelings at
the time of topic selection. At the time of topic selection, they're a
little anxious. And at the prefocus formulation they're getting even a
little bit more anxious because they're starting to look for
information, they have to identify resources, they have to use different
systems. And at the point of focus formulation users are starting to
level off again and feeling more comfortable.

Now, why that's important for us is because it tells us as reference
librarians where we should intervene, or what Kuhlthau calls the 'zone
of intervention.' Should we let users continue to look around for
themselves for a while and then come and questions? Or should we go and
say, "Can I help you with this?" Kuhlthau says to probably wait until
between stages two and three, somewhere during these stages is what she
calls the 'zone of intervention.' During the zone of intervention,
that's when you should jump in and say, "Maybe I can help you with this
different system," or "This resource might be better for you."

Step four is where users collect the information. They've decided on a
narrower topic, they've explored some different systems, some different
resources, and they start gathering some information on that narrower
topic.

Step five is the search closure where users complete their search, and
finally, the last step that Kuhlthaus has recently added, when users use
the information.

Now, this model appears to be linear, but at any point, you can go back
through the stages. If you get to stage two and you don't like this
general topic, so you might propose a whole completely new topic and
start over again.

Or you might get to three and you're not quite happy with that narrow
topic, so you go back and explore the general topic some more.

So, again, it's not necessarily a linear process. But what she's
primarily famous for, and especially in this model, is this whole
process, but also the affective states of the individual and when we
should actually intervene.

## Mann's Library Research Models 

`These are models for library searching, or how people (end-users and/or professionals) use resources and tools to find information`

-   Search options based on organization of information in libraries
-   Importance of models in concealing/revealing search options/indexing
    system
-   Applicability of models in any subject area, language, format

::: notes
Mann has developed some really interesting models. He's looked at
different search options that we've developed based on how we organize
information. Also, his models show the importance of our library systems
in revealing or concealing different pieces of information to our users.
How much can they tell about our resources by looking at a bibliographic
record? How useful is that? Do they actually use our pathfinders and our
finding aids?

He's also developed some different models, like for example, a specific
subject or discipline model. Mann has looked longitudinally at how
different disciplines look for information. For example, Social
scientists do what's called 'citation checking or chasing' where you
find a really good article and then you go and look at the citations in
the back and then you start chasing those down. People in the hard
sciences, like say chemistry and physics, they call their colleagues
before they do any research in our systems. They'll actually network
before they'll use a library database or to your library catalog.

So, through the years Mann developed these different models from
observing and working with people in reference situations.

The traditional library science model is one model that Mann examined
how people use different tools we've developed such as our
classification schemes, or controlled vocabulary or subject headings
within library catalogs, but also how people use bibliographies and
indexes.
:::

## Research Models

Examples: [Mann's Library Research Models](https://archive.org/details/libraryresearchm00mann)
(just a few, there are many others!)

-   Specific Subject or Discipline Model
-   Traditional Library Science Model
    -   Classification, controlled-vocabulary catalog, published
        bibliographies and indexes
-   Actual-Practice Model
-   Principle of Least Effort

::: notes
Mann's Actual practice model is a generic model of "What do people
really do when they look for information in, say, the Library of
Congress?" Do they ask reference librarians first? Do they go to the
OPAC first; do they go to a finding aid? So, he's examining a user's
process rather than lumping them into a group like we saw in some of the
earlier models.

The last one isn't Mann's model. We attribute it to Zipf. It's the
'principle of least effort,' but Mann has developed this model further.
This is the idea that people will go to the least amount of effort to
find what they need. How many of us are guilty of that? At some point or
another we all just want the information right now, right quick, and the
web makes it even easier for us to do this. We can also apply this model
to the Web. It's very interesting in early retrieval research, we knew
that people would probably access the first fifty hits when they
searched our OPACs, and believe it or not, that still carries into the
web. Most people don't go beyond the first fifty hits when they find
results on the search page.

So, these again are just some ideas of the different models we've
developed through the years.
:::

## How Do Questions Relate to Information Objects?

-   Information Object Attributes *(general characteristics, eg has a
    creator, size, content)*

-   Implications for practice: understanding users' information needs
    will help us create better representations for objects *(more
    efficient access)*

::: notes
So, you might ask, "How do these questions relate to information
objects?" and "Why is it important that we understand users when we're
organizing information?

If you ever take a look at search logs which capture all the searches
and terms that users input into a system to do a search, it's really
revealing about the types of words they use or the types of attributes
or fields they use when they're looking for particular objects in the
collection.

And so from that type of study, we can attempt to understand what the
users' information needs are as well as how they actually search for
information in your system.

The implications of understanding users' information needs really help
us create better representations for objects and provide more efficient
access.

So, knowing more about how our users interact with systems, the types of
problems or information needs they bring to a system, and then the
processes they undertake to find those needs is really important when
you're designing a system or when you're cataloging or creating
representation for the resources in a collection.

We'll explore this further.
:::

## Examples

-   User Question (1): *I want all the books by Janet Evanovich*

-   Attributes

    -   Format
    -   Creator

-   User Question (2): *I need to find current books or videos on new
    paint treatments for kitchens*

-   Attributes

    -   ????

::: notes
Let's take some examples of this.

Our user question might be, "I want all the books by Janet Evanovich."
When you look at that question, what are the attributes that you see
embedded within the words the user inputs into the system or they ask
the reference librarian? We have 'format' because they want books and we
have 'creator' because we're looking for books by a particular author.

Another example would be in user question two: "I need to find current
books or videos on new paint treatments for kitchens." Now, attributes
associated with this particular question might be 'date,' because
they're asking for current books, 'format' books or videos, and also
'subject' because they're interested in a particular subject area of new
paint treatments that they might use in kitchens.

So, you can see just from examining some basic questions that might come
to your library or your information organization, you can begin to get
an idea of the needs of your users. And, of course, this has many
different implications for practice related to the information
organization, but also related to, say, collection development and other
aspects of services we provide.
:::

## User Expectations

-   Expectations for Retrieval Performance (eg. `precision and recall`)

-   Other Measures: `Relevance or Pertinence`

::: notes
Another area that we look at when we think about user expectations for
our systems or for the representations that we create of the objects in
our collection are the concepts of retrieval, or *precision and recall*.

Recall assesses the output of the system, meaning that every object that
is related to that query in some way should be returned back to a user
in the list of hits in the system. It also assesses the ability of the
system to retrieve all relevant items, meaning that everything that is
retrieved in the set should be related to the subject or the attributes
in the user's question. So, if they're looking for all books on paint
treatments that you might have in your collection, they should return
all records related to paint treatments. If not, it's said to be 'low
recall.

Precision, on the other hand, assesses relevance of output, meaning it
assesses the ability of the system to retrieve only the relevant items.
So, precision is looking at how specifically the system has returned
only items that are appropriate to your query. As you can see, this
could be a problem, especially if the system is difficult to use or the
representations don't match the terms being used by the user themselves.
And as we'll talk about in later module that there are very different types of
systems and they operate in different ways, and that could impact both
recall and precision.

So, again, when we look at our users' queries, we can tell whether or
not they want a very precise return, and only the particular objects,
such as only books by Janet Evanovich or current books by a particular
author, and if they retrieve items that are not books or they retrieve
items not by that author, it's said that precision is very low. It's
also important to understand that our systems have an inverse
relationship between precision and recall, in that precision if it's
high, means that recall is generally pretty low.

We'll talk more about this in later module, but I wanted to address it
just briefly here. Other measures that you might see in the literature
related to retrieval are 'relevance' or 'pertinence' - or how useful
that information or that object is to the user.
:::

## What Do We Know About How People Organize Their Stuff?

-   Not Very Much!!

-   Personal Information Management

    -   In home spaces
    -   In professional spaces
    -   In digital spaces

-   In socially-constructed spaces

    -   Online, Web 2.0 environments like Flickr, LibraryThing

::: notes
Another really interesting area that's new to our field, but that also
helps us to better understand our users is what's called 'personal
information management' (PIM). We'll talk more about this later in the
semester. But PIM this is the research into how people
organize their stuff.

At this point we don't really know very much about how people organize
the 'stuff' in their lives - whether it's personal, whether it's, your
kitchen spice cabinet, or whether it's the list that you make to help
organize your day; or it's the digital stuff on your computer or your
various devices, but we are learning more.

In the areas of environmental design and in human - computer
interaction, personal information management has been researched for
quite a few years. I have given you a couple of readings related to this
because this is an area that I find particularly fascinating, but I also
think it tells us a lot about our users in general. We'll come back to it in later module, but it's a really interesting area of our field. We've looked
at different types of information management in our home spaces, in
professional spaces, and also now in digital spaces.

Also, another area that we learn about how people organize their
information on their webpages or their pictures or their videos is in
the socially constructed spaces that are online in Web 2.0 environments,
like LibraryThing and flickr.

There is quite a large body of research in this area now beginning back
with image researchers at least fifteen years ago. This week's
readings will help you begin to think about what we can really know
about how people organize their stuff and how that will then help us to
design better systems and create representations that are relevant, or
more user - centered.
:::

## Implications for Practice {.smaller}

`Models of Information Seeking....`

-   Guide development of user-centered services
    -   Reference
    -   Searching
    -   Indexing/Cataloging
    -   IR Systems Design
-   Librarians improve organization of resources to accommodate users'
    searching styles
-   Understand users'
    -   Decision-making criteria
    -   Process strategies
    -   Expectations of search process
    -   Attitudes and feelings
    -   Organization schemes (categories, labels, methods)

::: notes
Why is understanding the many complexities of users important to what
we're talking about in this class? Why am I boring you with all this
stuff?

First, understanding our users and their information behaviors and
organizing behaviors guide development of user - centered services, not
just in reference departments, not when we search, help our users
search, but also in indexing and cataloging.

The models we have developed and the research conducted into user
behaviors help us understand more about the kinds of searches people do.
What fields do they use in our databases? Do they only conduct author -
title, which are called known - item searches, or do they do more
subject searching?

So, when we're building a system, we're designing a system that we hope
will be useful. When we're creating representations, such as card
catalog records, knowing about how people go about looking for
information can help us design better systems. We'll know which fields
need to be searchable; we'll know which attributes or aspects of our
objects should be represented in our records.

So, again, knowing a little bit more about how our users look for, and
find information, and use information, can help us design systems that
are more in line with their information needs. This understanding also
can help us choose in terms when indexing and cataloging and to know
more about what level of terminology we need to use when representing
the subject content.

Furthermore, as a searcher, understanding the levels of exhaustively and
specificity that are present in the indexing or the cataloging in the
system can help you become a better searcher. Your search terms will be
more aligned with the actual vocabulary used by the cataloger or indexer
within the system. So, therefore, you should have better retrieval. You
can also help your users understand this and make them more efficient in
their searching as well.
:::

## Implications for Practice (Cont.) {.smaller}

-   Help us
    -   `Choose elements for system design`
        -   Fields to include in system
        -   Fields to make searchable (indexed)
        -   Creation of input rules
    -   `Choose appropriate controlled or other vocabulary to use (natural language, free text)`
    -   `Choose appropriate level of indexing`
        -   Exhaustivity
        -   Specificity
        -   Number of subject terms to include

::: notes
Other implications for practice that I did start to mention on the
previous slide are that understanding our users really helps us to
design a particular system for users. In libraries we tend to be very
generic in that our systems are for a very large, diverse audience of
individuals.

So, sometimes it's not possible to build a system that's going to
satisfy every user. In fact, it's really not possible to do so, unless
you have a very specialized collection, a very specialized user - group
and you understand very closely those users and their information
behaviors.

But learning about our users helps us to choose elements that we want to
include or that we know need to be included in our system design. It
helps us make decisions and to work with our vendors to determine what
fields to include and also which fields should be indexed or searchable
within your system. It also helps us to create input rules.

So, for those of you who are going to work on the organization system
project, there is a section in the project where you have the
opportunity to create input rules for each of the fields within your
system. This is analogous to the standards we use when we create catalog
records in library catalogs. We use the Resource Description and Access
(RDA) and other subject heading lists in order to create records in our
system, and those standards are sets of rules that guide catalogers.

Also, we use what we know about users to choose appropriate controlled
vocabulary or other types of vocabulary to represent subjects in our
systems. In libraries we tend to use Library of Congress Subject
Headings (LCSH) or Sears subject headings if we're in a school library.
We might use a user - specific ontology if we're in a business
community, where we've designed a specific ontology to represent the
language of that community. So, again, knowing about our users and the
types of searches or searches they do conduct really can help us in
these choices.

Also, it helps us choose the appropriate level of indexing in our
catalogs. How many subject terms do we need? How many fields do we need?
And there are two measures that we talk about in libraries called
'exhaustivity' and 'specificity' that really define the number of
subject terms or the level of exhaustiveness - how many terms do we use
to describe the content of an object for effective retrieval? How
specific should those terms be? Is it appropriate to have very specific
terms in the catalog or an academic library versus when we're creating
records for children, where we'll want to have more broad generalized
terms?

So, again, learning more about our users and the types of searching
systems they use really can help us determine all of these different
factors.

::: notes
Christine Borgman in her 1996 article, "Why are online catalogs still
hard to use?" explained why OPACs in libraries are difficult to use. Her
article is a really good one for giving you even more conceptual
framework for what we've addressed in this lecture.

System design models in the past were based upon the original card
catalog model and what could fit on the library catalog card. And
unfortunately, a lot of systems today are still based on that model. We
can fit on information about the author, the title, and maybe one to
three subject headings, and a classification code.

So, that's how our basic library systems were designed. In our next
generation catalogs we have improved the interface design, added more
searching functionality, and allow users to search using a "Google -
like" search box. BUT, and this is what is really important, their
retrieval is still based on the RECORDS or representations of items in
the collection that catalogers have developed.
:::

## IR System Design (Cont.)

`Traditionally IR System Design Often...`

-   Based on `assumptions about information-seeking` rather than
    research (although that is changing!)
-   `Directed toward system use by information professionals`, not
    end-users
-   `Forces system users to adapt to the system`, rather than adapts to
    users' natural abilities

::: notes
In our field and as new technologies are developed and as users start to
use different systems and start to use them in different ways, it also
forces us to rethink decisions and choices we've made in the past.
Again, that's why I think it's such an exciting time to be in our field
right now because we are really at the forefront of a lot of these
change.

Also, we've been designing and working through our records structures,
we've been designing XML systems that can work XML MARC, which gives us
even more functionality than the traditional MARC system might have. And
people are designing more user - centered systems when they create
digital libraries; we're not just using MARC record structures, we're
designing metadata schemes like Dublin Core.

What is in our library catalog records may not have changed much until
the recent 5 years with the development of the FRBR model and with the
new cataloging standard, RDA. AND when we move beyond the MARC record in
library catalogs into BIBFRAME, our records will hopefully connect to
other external records through this linked data structure. But that is
for another module.
:::

## IR System Design (Cont.)

`Good IR System Design Tends To Be...`

-   Based on study of users needs/interactions
-   Interactive to accommodate natural information-seeking behaviors
-   Flexible to accommodate differences among individual users

::: notes
In conclusion, good information retrieval system design should be based
on a study of our users, user needs, and their interactions with
different systems.

We need to understand the types of searches that they bring to a system.
We need to understand the attributes in those searches that should be
fields in our system. We also need to understand the exhaustivity and
specificity level of the terms that we use to represent subjects or
other concepts within our systems. And also, whether or not we need to
have very complex concepts represented. Or can the terms be very general
in nature?

Our systems also have to be very interactive to accommodate natural
information seeking behaviors. We need to think about how users really
do interact with systems at different levels - at their homes, in their
work environments - to try to make sure our systems can try to emulate
some of those natural behaviors.

Systems also need to be flexible to accommodate differences among
